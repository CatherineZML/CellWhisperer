The integration of timeof-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and RNA-sequencing identified unique inflammatorysignatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with ASCVD plasma. Bycomparing these inflammatory signatures to large-scale gene expression data from the LINCSL1000 dataset, we identified drugs that could reverse this inflammatory response.In conclusion, a systems immunology-driven drug repurposing with pre-clinical validation strategy can aid the development of new cardiovascular immunotherapies.", "treatment_protocol": "['Pbmcs diluted at 2x10^6 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% FBS, 1x P/S, were then plated into a 96-well deep well plate and put to rest at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 incubator for 2hrs.', 'Cell were then stimulated using either plasma isolated from atherosclerotic patients (disease plasma) or control plasma from healthy donors (healthy plasma) at a final concentration of 20% and incubated for 3 hrs at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.']", "geo_source_name": "peripheral blood mononuclear cells", "geo_title": "Disease plasma_PBMC_1_S1_L001", "raw_biosample_metadata": "source_name: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; cell_type: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; treatment: patient plasma stimulation; geo_loc_name: missing; collection_date: missing", "treatment": "treatment: patient plasma stimulation"}
