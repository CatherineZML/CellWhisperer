The cells were then plated into dishes coated with poly-L-ornithine (0.01%, Sigma #P4957), laminin (5 \u00b5g/ml, Invitrogen #23017-015) and fibronectin (1\u03bcg/ml, Corning, #354008,). Medium was changed 12 hr after plating and the cells were passaged using 0.25% trypsin within 3 d and replated to obtain a monolayer of cells at a density of 4\u20135 \u00d7 104 cells/cm2.

The culture system was then used to study ZIKV infection.Methods: Single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatic analysis on NES cells in culture and single cells from  5-6 post conception week (pcw), 16 pcw, as well as 19-20 pcw human fetal neocortex.Results: We find that NES cells are highly similar to RGCs and neural progenitor cells in terms of their gene expression profile. Both NES cells and neural stem cells/progenitors from fetal neocortex expressed canonical marker genes of proliferating and differentiating neuronal cells.Conclusions: We successfully established the NCX-NES cell culture as an experimental system for the study of neural stem cells and used it to study ZIKV infection", "treatment_protocol": NaN, "geo_source_name": "Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex", "geo_title": "C1-30-C5_GGACTCCT-TATCCTCT_L004_R1_all", "raw_biosample_metadata": "source_name: Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; donor: HSB313; age: PCW16; c1_chip: C1-30", "treatment": NaN}
