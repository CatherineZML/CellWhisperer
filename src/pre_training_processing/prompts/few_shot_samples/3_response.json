    "Relevant Information to be Included": [
        "Cell type: hepatocyte",
        "Sample type: cell line",
        "Condition: infected with HCV (strain Jc1)",
        "Treatment: UV-inactivated HCV (for PHH of donors 4-7)",
        "Treatment: JAK/STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib (to rescue HCV virion replication and release in PHHs)",
        "Treatment: HCV replication inhibitor 2â€™CMA (to confirm IRF1 mediated restriction of HCV replication and translation)",
        "Time post-infection: 6 hours",
        "Phenotypic effects: broad upregulation of IFN-mediated defense programs, translational shutoff in PHHs"
    ],
    "Final Response": "Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) cell line, infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) strain Jc1 for 6 hours. The cells exhibit a broad upregulation of interferon-mediated defense programs and a translational shutoff, indicating a cellular response to HCV infection."
